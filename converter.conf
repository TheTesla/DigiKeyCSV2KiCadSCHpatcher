# This is the config file for the digikeycsv2kicadschpatcher database converter
# easy to use:
#     INPUT, digikey.csv
#     >contained_in_tablehead, <tablehead_name_contained_in_this_string, =name_is_this_search_string, &write_this_string_to_output_file
#     INPUT, next_digikey.csv
#     =name_1, >name_2, ... 
#     OUTPUT, database.csv
#     head_name_1, $head_name_2 (float value), ...
#
# $value means output in double format, printed as scientific formated string
# -Tol means tolerance value lower bound printed
# +Tol - tolerance value upper bound
# This tolerance values can be %, ppm, ppb or 1 - factor is taken into account.
# If only one value is given, tolerance range is symmetric.
#
# range of Value:
# INPUT, input.csv
# 	>Tolerance, >Value, >Tolerance
# OUTPUT, out.csv
# 	[Value (lower bound), $Value, ]Value (upper bound)
#
# It is important that lower bound is one left of the Value and upper bound is one right of the Value.
